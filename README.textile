<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3>About Mongoid</h3>

<p>
  Mongoid is an ODM (Object-Document-Mapper) framework for MongoDB in Ruby.
</p>

<h3>Project Tracking</h3>

<a href="http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/27482">Mongoid on Pivotal Tracker</a>
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mongoid">Mongoid Google Group</a>
<a href="http://mongoid.org:4444/">Mongoid on CI Joe</a>

<h3>Compatibility</h3>

<p>
  Mongoid is developed against Ruby 1.8.6, 1.8.7, 1.9.1, 1.9.2
</p>

<p>
  Note API changes will be frequent until 1.0, releases will be frequent, and
  backwards compatibility will not be supported. Do not expect the gem to be of full
  production quality until that point. However, once 1.0 is released I will be providing
  backwards compatibility through each minor version upgrade, as well as detailed
  release notes and documentation with each release.
