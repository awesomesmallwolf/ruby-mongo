<h3>About Mongoloid</h3>

<p>
  Mongoloid is an ODM (Object-Document-Mapper) framework for MongoDB in Ruby. MongoDB differs from other 
  mapping frameworks in that it constrains the models into behaving in a manner appropriate for a 
  document database. That is to say there are no relationships between documents in the underlying datastore.
  If a relationship is set up in the Model the child models are automatically embedded within the parent document 
  in the database. The concept of a foreign key relationship to another Document does not exist, as that is 
  design and thinking for a relational database, not a document database. Mongoloid does however provide 
  all the ActiveRecord style functionality you need, with the difference that it stores all associations 
  within the parent document.

<h2>Mongoloid in Action</h2>

Initialize Mongoloid:

<pre>
  Mongoloid.connect_to("myapp_database_name")
</pre>

Example of a simple domain model:

<pre>
  class Person < Mongoloid::Document
    fields :title
    has_many :addresses
    has_one :name
  end
  
  class Address < Mongoloid::Document
    fields \
      :street,
      :city,
      :state,
      :post_code
    belongs_to :person
  end

  class Name < Mongoloid::Document
    fields \
      :first_name,
      :last_name
  end
</pre>

Create a new Document:

<pre>
  Person.create(:title => "Esquire")
</pre>

Save a Document:

<pre>
  person.save
</pre>

Delete a Document:

<pre>
  person.destroy
</pre>

Update a Document:

<pre>
  person.update_attributes(:title => "Sir")
</pre>

Search for a Document in the database:

<pre>
  Person.find(:all, :title => "Esquire")

  Person.find(:first, :title => "Esquire")
</pre>

Paginate Document search results:

<pre>
  Person.paginate(:title => "Esquire", :page => 1, :per_page => 20)
</pre>
