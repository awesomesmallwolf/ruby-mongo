=== 0.10.6
- Fixed bug when trying to set empty strings on number
  fields. (TypeError: can't convert Fixnum into String)

- Document.delete_all now drops the collection if
  conditions are empty or nil.

=== 0.10.5

- Documents that are embedded not properly respond to
  Document#destroy and Document#delete.

- Documents can now be saved sans validation with
  Document#save(false)

=== 0.10.4

- Documents no longer inherit from Mongoid::Document.
  Please include Mongoid::Document in all your models now.

- Config module added, you can now set one option:
  Mongoid.raise_not_found_error = (true|false)

  - When set to false, a Mongoid::Errors::DocumentNotFound
    will NOT get thrown when performing a Document.find(id)
    that does not return a document from the database.
    This defaults to true.

- Mongoid::Document.collection_name macro added. You can
  now set the name of the database collection to persist to.
